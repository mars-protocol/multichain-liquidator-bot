This file is intented as a temporary location for the osmosis concentrated liquidity math.

Once they have published their concentrated liquidity math to their math library @osmosis/math, we should delete this and migrate to that.

Don't add additional features to this folder - it should exaclty replicate the @osmosis/math package for concentrated liquidity
