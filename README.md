## Mars liquidation bots.


This repository houses the liquidation bots for the different Mars protocols (V1, V2) accross different chains (Neutron & Osmosis).

*Note that we currently use two separate branches for the two different protocol instances. Once Neutron is migrated to v2, we will merge marsv2 branch to main and delete the marsv1 branch*

In the mean time, if you want to liquidate on neutron, use the [mars v1 branch](https://github.com/mars-protocol/multichain-liquidator-bot/tree/marsv1)

If you want to liquidate on osmosis, use the  [mars v2 branch](https://github.com/mars-protocol/multichain-liquidator-bot/tree/marsv2)
